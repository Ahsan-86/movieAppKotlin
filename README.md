# movieAppKotlin
It is movie browsing application with a search feature and collapsing movie details screen.

I have used the below concepts using Kotlin for Android Development

- MVVM Architecture
- ViewModel
- Views
- Binding
- Android Kotlin fundamental ( Lazy keyword, lateinit keyword, nullable data type, dataclass)
- Retrofit (for API calls)
- Gson (for data parsing)
- PaperDb (for storing last viewed information)
